<!--
  Note: The way that a .then() block works is similar to when you add an event listener to an object using AddEventListener().
  It doesn't run until an event occurs (when the promise fulfills).
  The most notable difference is that a .then() will only run once for each time it is used,
  whereas an event listener could be invoked multiple times.

  Note: You will probably notice that these examples are somewhat contrived.
  You could just do away with the whole fetch() and blob() chain,
  and just create an <img> element and set its src attribute value to the URL of the image file coffee.jpg.
  We did, however, pick this example because it demonstrates promises in a nice simple fashion,
  rather than for its real-world appropriateness.
