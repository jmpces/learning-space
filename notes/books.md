## Software Engineering

1. **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** (Gang of Four) - _The first/original book that documents software design patterns in OOP. This is more like a diehard documentation than an easy going tutorial._

2. **Head First Design Patterns** - _This book also discusses the design patterns from the original book in #1, but people say this book is more hands-on than the original design patterns book._

3. **Game Programming Patterns** (It also has an online version here: [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/introduction.html)) - _This book also explores design patterns in book #1, but is applied to game development._

4. **Clean Code** (Robert C. Martin | Uncle Bob) - _About the SOLID principles._

5. **Clean Coder** (Robert C. Martin | Uncle Bob) - _A code of conduct book to adhere to when practicing/implementing Clean Code (#4)._

6. **Clean Architecture** (Robert C. Martin | Uncle Bob) - _About software architecture with a focus on Clean Code (#4)._

7. **SFML Game Development** - _Game development with a slightly older version of C++, but the concepts can still be applied to modern C++._
