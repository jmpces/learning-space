# Creational Pattern

1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Intent: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
   - Description: The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a way to access that instance globally. This is useful when you want to ensure that there's only one instance of a class throughout the application's lifecycle, such as a configuration manager or a database connection pool.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**:
   - Intent: Define an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - Description: The Factory Method pattern provides an abstract method for creating objects in a superclass, while concrete subclasses implement this method to create specific object instances. This allows for flexibility in object creation and ensures that the client code remains unaware of the specific classes being instantiated.

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
   - Intent: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - Description: The Abstract Factory pattern defines an interface for creating families of related objects, such as different types of products that share common characteristics. Concrete implementations of the abstract factory provide the means to create instances of these related objects. This pattern is useful when you need to create sets of objects that work together.

4. **Builder Pattern**:
   - Intent: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
   - Description: The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object into separate steps, allowing you to create different variations of the object using the same construction process. This is particularly useful when dealing with objects that have multiple parts or configuration options.

5. **Prototype Pattern**:
   - Intent: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
   - Description: The Prototype pattern involves creating a prototype instance that serves as a template for creating new instances. Rather than instantiating new objects from scratch, you copy the prototype and customize the copied instance as needed. This is helpful when creating new instances is resource-intensive, and you want to avoid the overhead of full object creation.

Each of these Creational Patterns addresses different aspects of object creation and initialization, providing developers with strategies to manage object instantiation in a flexible and organized manner.
