// [optional] follow this steps if opencv compilation does not work: error: libopencv_core.so.4.5 cannot open...

1. 
	sudo find / -name "libopencv_core.so.^.^*"   <- the ^ here is the version number that the compiler is saying

	usually though these files is locatet in /usr/local/lib/libopencv_core.so.^.^
	
2.
	Create a file called /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf
	then write the directory you found in step 1 where you found the libopencv_core... to the created opencv.conf, example below
	/usr/local/lib/

3.
	then run the command below
	sudo ldconfig -v

g++ -o test.o test.cpp -std=c++11 `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`


-----------------------------------------------------

For static builds, all steps are also the same but... you might need to edit the pkgconfig file of opencv.pc in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv4.pc
because some times the installation might not set the proper path or might double the "usr/local/lib/lib" path of
your libraries

you might also need to move the opencv2 folder inside the /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2 into the include directory (one level down)

to compile statically use:

g++ main.cpp -o test `pkg-config --cflags --libs --static opencv4`
