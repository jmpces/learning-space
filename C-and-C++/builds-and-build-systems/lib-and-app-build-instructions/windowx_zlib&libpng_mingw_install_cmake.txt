HOW TO BUILD & INSTALL ZLIB WITH LIBPGN IN WINDOWS USING MINGW64-POSIX AND CMAKE

ADD THE BIN FOLDER OF MINGW64 TO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

compiler requirements : mingw64 - POSIX

Requirements:
	- Mingw64 - Posix (you maybe you can also use mingw32 but I don't know if that will work the same)
	- cmake (atm: i'm using "cmake version 3.20.0-rc3")

1. install Zlib:

	cd "your/zlib/path"
	mkdir "build"
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="your/zlib/build/path" .
	mingw32-make
	mingw32-make install

2. add the "bin", "include", and "lib" folder of zlib/build to your environment variables

3. install libpng:

	cd "your/libpgn/path"
	mkdir "build"
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="your/libpng/build/path" .
	mingw32-make
	mingw32-make install
