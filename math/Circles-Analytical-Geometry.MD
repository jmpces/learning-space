# **Circles - Analytical Geometry**

A **circle** is the set of all points on a plane that are
**equidistant** from a fixed point on the plane.
The fixed point is called the center, and the distance
from the **center** to any point of the circle is
called the **radius**. 

Let the center of a circle be at the fixed point $C(h,k)$,
and let the radius be equal to $r$.

## **Radius Formula**

Used to check if a given point $P(x,y)$ is a part of a circle, if it is
the answer should be the same as the given radius.

$$\sqrt{(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2} = r$$

## **Center-Radius Form**

$$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2$$


If the center is $C(0,0)$ then we can denote the equation
of the circle as $x^2+y^2=r^2$.

## **General Form**

$$
x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F=0
