# Unusual Rust jargon

List of weird rust jargon, that I've never heard of in other programming language.

- **arms** - block of code associated with the conditions in an if expressions.

- **borrowing** - The action of creating a reference, can be achieved using the reference operator `&`.

- **non-lexical lifetimes** - The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope.
