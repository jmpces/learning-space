# Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Machine Learning

Algorithms that trains on **labeled datasets**, the two types of problems
that supervised learning based machine learning algorithm solves are.

1. Regression Problems
  - simple linear regression
  - multivariate regression
2. Classification Problems
  - logistic regression

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

Algorithms that trains on **unlabeled datasets**, group or categorize them
according to the similarities, patterns and differences.

1. Clustering - finding inherent groups from the data.
  - K-Means Clustering
2. Association - finds interesting relations among variables within the dataset.

## Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

The main aim of semi-supervised learning is to effectively use all the available data, rather than only labelled data like in supervised learning
  
## Reinforcement Learning

Focuses on the feedback-based process: `PERFORM WELL -> GET REWARDED`,`PERFORM BAD -> RECEIVE PUNISHMENT`, The main goal is to maximize the reward.

1. **Positive Reinforcement Learning**
2. **Negative Reinforcement Learning**
