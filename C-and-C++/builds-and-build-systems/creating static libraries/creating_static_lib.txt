With the static library, we can statically link main.o with the library.
The -L flag indicates (a non standard) directory where the libraries can be found.
The -l flag indicates the name of the library. Note, that it assumes the library to start with lib and end with .o (so lib and .o must not be specified)

# object files for shared libraries need to be compiled as position independent
# code (-fPIC) because they are mapped to any position in the address space.


sample code with sample files:

g++ -I./ -c add.cpp -o add.o
ar rcs libmath.a add.o
g++ -I./ main.cpp -L./ -lmath -o main.o
./main.o


-c       Suppresses the diagnostic message that  is  written
          to  standard  error  by  default  when  archive  is
          created.

 -r       Replaces or adds files in archive. If archive  does
          not  exist,  a  new  archive  file is created.

 -v       Gives verbose output. When used  with  options  -d,
          -r,  or  -x,  the -v option writes a detailed file-
          by-file description of the archive creation and the
          constituent  files,  and maintenance activity.

 -s       Forces the regeneration of the archive symbol table
          even  if ar is not invoked with an option that will
          modify the archive contents.
