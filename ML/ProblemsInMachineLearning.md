# Problems In Machine Learning

- **Regression** - Predicting **numerical values** e.g. house price predition
- **Classification** - Predicting the category of input data.
  - **Binary Classification** on/off, yes/no, etc.
  - **Multi-Nomial Classification** Multiple percentage output per class.
- **Clustering** - Categorizes the data into groups. 
- **Time-series forecasting** - 
- **Anomaly detection** - Finding outliers or unexpected data. (IsolationForest, Minimum covariance determinant, Local outlier factor, One-class SVM, GAN (detection part))
- **Ranking** - (Bipartite Ranking)
- **Recommendation**
- **Data generation** - GAN (generator part)
- **Optimization** - Genetic Programming, Backpropagation?
