# Design Patterns

The "Gang of Four" book, also known as "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," is a seminal work in the field of software design and object-oriented programming. It was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who are collectively referred to as the "Gang of Four" (GoF).

Published in 1994, this book has had a significant impact on software development practices. It introduces 23 design patterns, which are common solutions to recurring problems in software design. These patterns are categorized into three main groups:

1. [**Creational Patterns**](design-patterns-gang-of-four/creational/creational.md): These patterns deal with the process of object creation, trying to make it more flexible and efficient. Examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory patterns.

2. [**Structural Patterns**](design-patterns-gang-of-four/structural/structural.md): These patterns focus on how objects are composed or structured to form larger structures. Examples include the Adapter, Composite, and Proxy patterns.

3. [**Behavioral Patterns**](design-patterns-gang-of-four/behavioral/behavioral.md): Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects, how they operate together, and how responsibilities are assigned. Examples include the Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

The book provides in-depth explanations of each pattern, including their intent, motivation, structure, participants, and consequences. It also includes code examples in C++ and Smalltalk, although the patterns are applicable to a wide range of programming languages.

Design patterns help developers solve common design problems while promoting code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility. They are considered a fundamental part of object-oriented software engineering, and understanding these patterns can greatly improve the quality and efficiency of software development. The GoF book is often regarded as a must-read for software engineers and remains a classic reference in the field.
