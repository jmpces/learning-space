# Linear Regression

Solves regression problems.

The primary goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the actual observed data and the predictions made by the model.

Predicting numerical values, understanding relationships between variables, and identifying the strength and direction of associations in data.

If single independent variable is used for prediction then it is called **Simple Linear Regression**.

If there are more than two independent variables then such regression is called as **Multiple Linear Regression**.

Least square estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.

# Logistic Regression

Solves classification problems

It can be used for Classification as well as for Regression problems, but mainly used for Classification problems.

The output(s) of Logistic Regression problem can be only **between** the 0 and 1 (probabilities).

Logistic regression is based on the concept of Maximum Likelihood estimation. According to this estimation, the observed data should be most probable.
