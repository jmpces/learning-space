Install libpng in windows using mingw64 and cmake

Requirements:
	- Mingw64 - Posix (you maybe you can also use mingw32 but I don't know if that will work the same)
	- cmake (atm: i'm using "cmake version 3.20.0-rc3")
	- zlib source
	- libpng source
  
cmake and Mingw64 bin's should be already in your environment variables

1. open your cmd

2. install Zlib:

	cd "your/zlib/path"
	mkdir "build"
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="your/zlib/build/path"
	mingw32-make
	mingw32-make install
  
3. close your cmd before adding the environment variables
   so that when you install libpng cmake will find zlib

4. add the "bin", "include", and "lib" folder of zlib/build to your environment variables

5. open your cmd again

6. install libpng:

	cd "your/libpgn/path"
	mkdir "build"
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="your/libpng/build/path"
	mingw32-make
	mingw32-make install
