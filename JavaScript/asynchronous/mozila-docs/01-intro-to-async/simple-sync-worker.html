<!-- using workers to solve the problem in sumple-sync.html:

Now when you click the button, the browser is able to display
the paragraph before the dates have finished calculating.
Once the worker has finished calculating, it logs the final
date to the console. The first operation no longer blocks the second.

      Web workers are pretty useful, but they do have their limitations.
      A major one is they are not able to access the DOM â€” you can't get a worker
      to directly do anything to update the UI. We couldn't render our 1 million
      blue circles inside our worker; it can basically just do the number crunching.

      The second problem is that although code run in a worker is not blocking,
      it is still basically synchronous. This becomes a problem when a function
      relies on the results of multiple previous processes to function.
