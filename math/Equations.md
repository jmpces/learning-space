# Equations

## Flipping Signs

We can flip all the signs of an equation, this is the same with multiplying
both sides of the equation to `-1`, when this happened the resulting equation
is still the same.

Examples:
- The equation **$15x+35y=-10$**, is equal to **$-15x-35y=10$**
- The equation **$3x^{2\ }-2x\ +4y=0$**, is equal to **$-3x^{2\ }+2x\ -4y=0$**
